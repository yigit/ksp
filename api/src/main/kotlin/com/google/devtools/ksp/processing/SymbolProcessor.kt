 * [SymbolProcessor] is the interface used by plugins to integrate into Kotlin Symbol Processing.

 * of every round, which will be passed to proceesors again in the next round, together with the newly generated symbols.
 * Upon Exceptions, KSP will try to distinguish the exceptions from KSP and exceptions from processors.
 * Exceptions will result in a termination of processing immediately and be logged as an error in KSPLogger.
 * Exceptions from KSP should be reported to KSP developers for further investigation.
 * At the end of the round where exceptions or errors happened, all processors will invoke onError() function to do
 * their own error handling.
